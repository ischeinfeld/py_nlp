##### Thanks
Thank you to Prof. Michael Collins, PhD. and graduate student Karl
Stratos (both of Columbia University) for their extensive guidance
in my development of this project and my foray into NLP.

##### Disclaimer/Excuses :)
NOTE: this software was written as an experiment during the spring/summer of 2015.
It is not optimized for practical use, rather it was written as a direct translation
of the underlying concepts. Looking back, I would have done many things differently.
It is also not commented or documented (especially in its lower level functions and
classes) so as to make it friendly to any user besides myself.
